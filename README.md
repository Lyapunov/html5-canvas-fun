# html5-canvas-fun

According to a story, when Enzo Ferrari, the legendary Italian car maker got bored, he got into his Mini Cooper S and went up in the hills to tear around with, just for fun.

When I'm getting bored, I entertain myself with coding raw, simple and nostalgic stuffs.

The topics of the stuffs in this repo are originating from '90s. They were popular at that time, and I found them in various sources. E.g. see item 7, it is the starfield screen saver of Windows 3.1. Or see the rotating cube. It seemed everyone was writing rotating cube. ( And rotating pyramids, rotating cylinders, rotating hexagonal prisms. No, I am not kidding. )

I coded all of these once in Turbo Pascal and Asm. But hey, today I don't really need to pet a dinosaur to write a rotating cube. A web browser and a text editor do a much better job together. Using Html 5 Canvas + Javascript is just like mixing the good parts of everything I saw before. The basics are lightweight, getting to see the first primitives takes only 60 lines or so. Neato!

If coding is not fun, then you do it in the wrong way.
